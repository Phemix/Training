AWS Notes

AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE
------------------------------
Region - One or More Availability Zone
Availability - DAta Centers in a region that are connected
Edge Locations - more like CDNs, server Amazon CloudFront and DNS 53 Service


CREDS
-------
6qHya|xl$Mm| - Password
LuioHjAEZ3xqF+8FgLb2Kojd4ykzxD2cMkcMRv0r - Access Key


SERVICES AND AVAILABILITY
-------------------------
S3 is available in every region so does not specify a region in the ARN
IAM is also available in every region
VPCs are region based, subnets are subject to Availability Zones
EC2 is Region dependent


NETWORK
--------
1st 4 and last address in a subnet are reserved by Amazon for special purposes
NACLs are stateless and applies to the whole subnet within VPC
Security Groups are like NACL but apply to an instance
Peer Connection connects two VPCs
Direct Connect is how you connect from one Amazon region to another without using the public internet

INSTANCE METADATA 
----------------
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ can be used to obtain info bout instance ONLY



Bootstrapping with user data

AWS LAMBDA
-----------
Runs code serverlessly


S3
----------
Spans the whole region, uses all AZs in the region
Durable to the loss of 2 AZs
No filesystem but objects and buckets
Can use SSE (Server Side Encryption - AES 256) 
uses object storage vs block storage which is better
Bucket Security can be done with Resource Policy
Glacier - Archival Storage
Lifecycle Rules - rules to detrmine of how stuff are auto archived to Glacier

EC2
------------
Instance Store Volume - comes with EC2 and terminates with terminating the volume
EBS Volume - can be attched to EC2, pay per provisioned, connected over the network, encrypted and stays in single AZ
EBS Snapshot - stored in S3, can be used to create another volume, 


Amazon RDS
------------
You responsible for only queries
RDS Reliability - Same RDS in a different instance in a different AZ/subnet
Can be backed up with snapshots into S3
