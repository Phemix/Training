DLL
-------
DLL files are binary files that can contain executable code and resources like images, etc. Unlike applications, these cannot be directly executed, but an application will load them as and when they 
are required (or all at once during startup).

DUMPBIN
--------------
You have to use an external tool like DUMPBIN or Dependency Walker 
which will not only show what publicly visible functions (known as exports) are contained inside the DLL files and also what other DLL files it requires and which exports from those DLL files this DLL file is dependent upon

EVENTS
--------------
Always track the 4672 that follow the 4624 events
5140 - FIle share mounted
106 - Task Scheduled
200 - Task executed
201 - Task completed
141 - Task removed


RDP Forensics Shii
--------------------
1149 - Remote Cnnectn Mgr (authenticated)
21  - Logon Sucess
23  - Logoff
24  - Disconnect

*RDP Logins are Logon Type 3


SVCHOST
------------------
A generic host that runs apps mostly from DLLs.
The svchost.exe file is located in the folder C:\Windows\System32

To check tasks that are run by svc, run *taslist /svc*
Current version run key set so SW is activated when user logs in



%4 probably means space


*REdline can probably be used for memory analysis


Download Process Explorer to see more better view of svchost


Windows Code
--------------
%systemroot%  is C:\Windows and identical to %windir%


%systemdrive%\system32\inetsrv\config - This file will list the site name, site ID, web root, and log file path for each configured IIS site


HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate controls if files would be updated or not

The $LogFile is located within the root of each NTFS volume and is typically 64MB by default. The log is circular and can roll over on a frequent basis
The journal is located in path \$Extend\$UsnJrnl. You may not find the USN journal on every volume because it’s not strictly required by NTFS

The Volume Shadow Copy (VSC) service provides a mechanism for maintaining point-in-time copies, also known as “snapshots” or “restore points,” of files on an entire volume

%ALLUSERSPROFILE% 
-----------
%ALLUSERSPROFILE% is C:/ProgramData

SYMANTEC
--------------
The default location for Symantec Endpoint Protection client logs is %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\Logs

Symantec Endpoint Protection creates quarantine files in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\Quarantine folder by default. The quarantine files have a file extension of .vbn (VBN) and are stored in a custom format


 
 
 MS SQL SERVER

 C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11. 
 MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG
 
  The files that store actual MSSQL database content have extensions of .mdf and .ldf. The MDF files are the primary database files, and the LDF files contain transaction log data. These files are stored in a directory named Data within the MSSQL server instance directory. 
  
 MYSQL
 ---------
 
 MySQL configuration file, typically named my.cnf or my.conf, will indicate what logging is enabled, where the log files are, and the location of database storage. The configuration file is normally in /etc, /etc/mysql or one of those directories under the /usr/local directory.
 
 APACHE
 ---------------
 
 Common names of the Apache configuration file are httpd.conf, apache.conf, and apache2.conf. In Unix environments, common configuration file locations are /etc, /etc/apache, /etc/apache2, and each of those paths use /usr/local as a prefix.
 
 In a Unix environment, common Apache log directories are /var/log/httpd, /var/log/apache, and /var/log/apache2
 
  In Unix environments, a common default content location also called a web root, is /var/www
