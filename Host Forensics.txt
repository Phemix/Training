DLL
-------
DLL files are binary files that can contain executable code and resources like images, etc. Unlike applications, these cannot be directly executed, but an application will load them as and when they 
are required (or all at once during startup).

DUMPBIN
--------------
You have to use an external tool like DUMPBIN or Dependency Walker 
which will not only show what publicly visible functions (known as exports) are contained inside the DLL files and also what other DLL files it requires and which exports from those DLL files this DLL file is dependent upon

SVCHOST
------------------
A generic host that runs apps mostly from DLLs.
The svchost.exe file is located in the folder C:\Windows\System32

To check tasks that are run by svc, run *taslist /svc*
Current version run key set so SW is activated when user logs in



%4 probably means space


*REdline can probably be used for memory analysis


Download Process Explorer to see more better view of svchost


Windows Code
--------------
%systemroot%  is C:\Windows and identical to %windir%


%systemdrive%\system32\inetsrv\config - This file will list the site name, site ID, web root, and log file path for each configured IIS site


HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem\NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate controls if files would be updated or not

The $LogFile is located within the root of each NTFS volume and is typically 64MB by default. The log is circular and can roll over on a frequent basis
The journal is located in path \$Extend\$UsnJrnl. You may not find the USN journal on every volume because it’s not strictly required by NTFS

The Volume Shadow Copy (VSC) service provides a mechanism for maintaining point-in-time copies, also known as “snapshots” or “restore points,” of files on an entire volume
