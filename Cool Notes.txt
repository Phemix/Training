DLL
-------
DLL files are binary files that can contain executable code and resources like images, etc. Unlike applications, these cannot be directly executed, but an application will load them as and when they 
are required (or all at once during startup).

DUMPBIN
--------------
You have to use an external tool like DUMPBIN or Dependency Walker 
which will not only show what publicly visible functions (known as exports) are contained inside the DLL files and also what other DLL files it requires and which exports from those DLL files this DLL file is dependent upon
